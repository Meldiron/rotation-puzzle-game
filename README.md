# :arrows_clockwise: Daniel’s rotate puzzle game

A very simple puzzle game where you have to rotate pieces of an image to complete a puzzle.

You can [play the game here](https://bence-toth.github.io/daniel-rotation-puzzle-game/).


## Inspiration and acknowledgements

We started building this game together with my (at the time of writing) two-year-old son, Daniel.

And then I decided to finish it for his 3rd birthday, which was on 5 October 2020.

Without him, this could not have happened, I am very proud of him, and I am eternally grateful. :heart:

This is the second part of a game series made for toddlers and small children. If you are interested, check out [the first game](https://github.com/bence-toth/daniel-memory-game).
